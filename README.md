# Enigma Machine Simulator

A Java program that simulates the Enigma Machine (https://brilliant.org/wiki/enigma-machine/)

Wirings and specs details are from Wikipedia and http://users.telenet.be/d.rijmenants/en/enigmatech.htm#plugboard

I'm just really intrigued by this machine that played such an important role in World War 2. The design is so simple but it allows billions of different configurations for encoding.
